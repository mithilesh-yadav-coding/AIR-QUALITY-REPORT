🌍 Project Spotlight: Air Quality Report 🌍

I'm excited to share my latest Power BI project, titled "Air Quality Report," where I dove deep into the analysis of air quality data across different regions. This project was an eye-opener, revealing the critical impact of air pollution on both our environment and public health.

🔑 Key Points:

Comprehensive analysis of air quality indices (AQI) across multiple cities and timeframes.
Identification of trends and patterns in pollutant levels, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO2.
Visualization of air quality data through interactive and dynamic dashboards.

🎯 Objectives:

To understand the variations in air quality across different regions and over time.
To highlight the correlation between industrial activities, traffic, and rising pollution levels.
To provide actionable insights that can aid policymakers and environmental agencies in decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques:

Data Collection: Leveraged datasets from reputable environmental monitoring agencies.
Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query and DAX in Power BI.
Visualization: Created interactive dashboards with slicers, maps, and charts to depict AQI trends and pollutant levels.

📈 What I Learned:

Data Cleaning: Gained hands-on experience in handling large datasets, dealing with missing values, and ensuring data accuracy.
Visualization Best Practices: Enhanced my ability to present complex data in a user-friendly manner, making insights accessible to a broader audience.
Environmental Insights: Deepened my understanding of the factors influencing air quality and the importance of monitoring these metrics.
